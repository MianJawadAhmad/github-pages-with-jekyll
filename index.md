I am React and React Native developer with four years of experience. In my four years journey of react-native, i clear my concept before 2 years. it means that in the first two years I didn’t clear my concepts about the react-native.
Because I started to react-native in the wrong way. when I start to react-native i even didn’t touch the web technologies, At that time I was working in C++ and java.
With these reasons for not knowing about the roadmap of react-native to what to learn before starting to react-native the react-native development become so difficult and hectic. now we will start.

#What should I learn before, to become a react native developer?
This question is so important for beginners to react native development journey. If you are confused about selecting the technology, don’t worry react native is the best technology to learn.

#Before learning react native the things to learn.

#Javascript
In javascript, you have to learn the basics with some object-oriented concepts, and little functional programming. The course I am recommending for javascript before react native. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCwa_xi0Uuc this is the link I will recommend to you go there and watch this video.

#ReactJS
Now I hope you learn the javascript basic concepts, its time to dirty your hands with reactJS. In reactjs, you will learn the basic concepts with the redux, saga and hooks concepts.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0 this is the link I will recommend to you go there and watch this video.

#What is good for beginner to use, react-native expo or react native cli?
Most of the time beginners started using expo for their ease but I will recommend starting with react native cli. Because the expo is not good with big projects, when you start using expo you learn about the expo, the good practice for react native is to start with react native cli.

#Which UI Library is useful and easy to use for react-native application development?
People are using many libraries to react-native UI. Some libraries for React Native UI are.
#1. NativeBase

Native base one of the top library to react native UI. I am using Native base from 4 years. The native base is providing cross-platform components.

React Native Elements library is very popular for react-native components. It has over 120000 stars.
These are the libraries to use for UI. We have more than 50 libraries of react-native UI.
Which starter kit to use?
The starter kit helps you to start your application without setting your environment. The starter kit provides you with generated redux, screen generations and many more. The starter kit adds useful libraries in project creation time so the developer doesn’t have to install them again.
Ignite

Ignite starter kit is more popular in all. I am using ignite cli for 4 years.
